# CopperStudios.Engine3D
3D Version of my experimental engine. Made with [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs), [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET), and my [C# Tools](https://github.com/OlympianGames/CopperStudios.CsTools)

## Usage
Most engine scripts are under the 'Engine' folder, while game specific assets should be in the 'Game' folder. Registering game objects is done by either using the 'RegisterGameObject' function in either the 'Program' file or the function in the base 'GameObject' script. From there is Raylib, ImGUI, and C#. There is no set way to use any of them or this engine, and all of this is suggestions honestly.

## ToDo

 - [ ] Add Lighting and Shader engines.
 - [ ] Add github wiki
 - [ ] Add game samples?
